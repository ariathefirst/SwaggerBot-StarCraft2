# StarCraft II Project

Feel free to edit.




## Timeline

#### Week four : 4.22-4.29
1.Understand what PySC2 API allows us to do by reading [PySC2 implementations](https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2) and this [DeepMind paper](https://deepmind.com/documents/110/sc2le.pdf) . 

>  **Important:** Look at the [action.py](https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2/blob/cad5a011492372abf484bd7a8cc69e7ed24b8d8c/pysc2/lib/actions.py). <br/>

2.Understanding every line of the code in all the files in this [Github tutorial](https://github.com/skjb/pysc2-tutorial). This an accompany [Medium post](https://chatbotslife.com/building-a-basic-pysc2-agent-b109cde1477c) for the Github repo.
Get all the agents from aforementioned tutorial up and running in your computer, so that you figure out how to create a simplge agent.<br/>
3.Finish the proposal.

4.Implement [A-Guide-to-DeepMind-s-StarCraft-AI-Environment](https://github.com/llSourcell/A-Guide-to-DeepMinds-StarCraft-AI-Environment). This might be more time-consuming as you need to download all the maps, but it shows the graphical dashboard about how the agent works.

### Github Repo

** Authors of xhujoy/pysc2-agents [Reinforcement Learning Agent using Tensorflow (actorcritic)](https://github.com/xhujoy/pysc2-agents) and [pekaalto/sc2aibot (actorcritic)] (https://github.com/pekaalto/sc2aibot) were the first to attempt replicating [1](https://deepmind.com/documents/110/sc2le.pdf) and their implementations were used as a general inspiration during development of this project, however their aim was more towards replicating results than architecture, missing key aspects, such as full feature and action space support. Authors of simonmeister/pysc2-rl-agents also aim to replicate both results and architecture, though their final goals seem to be in another direction. Their policy implementation was used as a loose reference for this project. **
