List of existing agents and their features which we could implement in our agent:

1. Advantage Actor-Ctitic agent baseline for pysc2 environment.

    Understanding how to 
    
        
2. UAlbertaBot is a StarCraft C++ bot
  - It makes use of Build order planning that is based on heuristic search. 
  - Real time Simulation - All battles UAlbertaBot encounters are first run through SparCraft combat simultaion system. I
    If the outcome of this simulation is positive then it continues toward the enmy base.
    If the outcome is negative, retreat toward own base. 
  - Stratedy Selection based on results of previous matches.

3. Agent that uses all features maps and structured information to predict actions via A3C algorithm. 
  - Good code to understand lightwieght framework for deep reinforcement learning that uses asynchrounous gradient descent for optimization of deep neural network controllers.
