# StarCraft II Project

Hi! I'm your first Markdown file in **StackEdit**. If you want to learn about StackEdit, you can read me. If you want to play with Markdown, you can edit me. If you have finished with me, you can just create new files by opening the **file explorer** on the left corner of the navigation bar.




## Timeline

#### Week four : 4.22-4.29
1.Understand what PySC2 API allows us to do by reading [PySC2 implementations](https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2) and this [DeepMind paper](https://deepmind.com/documents/110/sc2le.pdf) . 

>  **Important:** Look at the [mini-game](https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2/blob/master/docs/mini_games.md). I will we should narrow down to a dead simple goal.<br/>

2.Understanding every line of the code in all the files in this [Github tutorial](https://github.com/skjb/pysc2-tutorial). This an accompany [Medium post](https://chatbotslife.com/building-a-basic-pysc2-agent-b109cde1477c) for the Github repo.
Get all the agents from aforementioned tutorial up and running in your computer, so that you figure out how to create a simplge agent.<br/>
3.Finish the proposal.

4.Implement [A-Guide-to-DeepMind-s-StarCraft-AI-Environment](https://github.com/llSourcell/A-Guide-to-DeepMinds-StarCraft-AI-Environment). This might be more time-consuming as you need to download all the maps, but it shows the graphical dashboard about how the agent works.

**Optional**
1. Understand how the [Advantage Actor-Critic agent in this Github Repo](https://github.com/simonmeister/pysc2-rl-agents) works by reading this [blogpost](https://hackernoon.com/intuitive-rl-intro-to-advantage-actor-critic-a2c-4ff545978752).
