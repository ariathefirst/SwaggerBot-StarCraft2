Update:
I migrate everything previously here to the timeline.md. 
Post what you did and how we can use your code here.

1. Delete preped data and parsed replay because we hit github storage upper limit. [Download here in Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-CnHdD1T8P09XixGYlDI_8pSs4iSZQN5?usp=sharing) .

2. Upload pytorch_dqn_agent. Run it ./run_agent.sh. I am still fixing bugs, but it is pretty promising. I tried the 
author's [other two agents](https://github.com/wohlert/starcraft-agent-pytorch) and both worked. 
> To-do: Add the [refined agent's actions](https://github.com/skjb/pysc2-tutorial/blob/master/Refining%20the%20Sparse%20Reward%20Agent/refined_agent.py) to the DQN agent.
